                For the starting week Blaine took us through a brief introduction of HTML and CSS, with the main focus being on the development tools we would be using throughout this course. We had a variety of admin work to do, which included application downloads/website sign ups/account creation etc. An interesting element of this week was using the developer tools to inspect websites we enjoyed and try to understand how we could incorporate basic aspects of found website to our blogs.

                This week we began researching and creating simple wireframes for our blog. The idea was to illustrate the key elements we would incorporate, whilst simultaneously taking inspiration from established websites on compositional aspects of the websites/blogs main aspects. We continued to make progress on our blogs but at this stage my understanding was still inhibited so any work I developed was of no use to the final structure of the blog, however it was important to me to experiment with the coding and gain a better grasp of how it all functioned based on my trial and error experiments.

            This week was centered around learning how to use Figma, so that we could visually produce ideas and create wireframes that would guide our coding process. I found Figma to be responsive and familiar but the lack of keyboard shortcuts and placement of tools in contrast to Adobe products was throwing me off slightly, along with hindering my work speed. I decided that in future when developing wireframes, I would swap to Adobe XD as I was more comfortable with it, along with the cloud saving keeping all my different projects in one area being a big bonus.

            We were at the beginnings of our first assignment this week, and Josh and Blaine set about the room to help students with personal problems regarding the assignment. My problem was that I’d shot to far ahead to early without considering the structural problems. I was getting confused about the appropriate number of pages and what they should address and so on until Josh explained to me that I should start with User Stories. User Stories turned out to be extremely helpful in planning my web layout and the contents it would contain. I was able to divulge the needs and wants of my theoretical target base, so with this knowledge in mind it was easier and faster to develop my wireframes as I now had a reference for structural guidance. We also experimented with CSS grid layouts and learned how to adapt the grid to certain needs.

            I spent a great amount of focus on my assignment during this week as the deadline was fast approaching. I had collected most of the data and information needed, so it was a case of converging all of this into a presentable manner; which was done using InDesign.

            This week we digitally rendezvoused with our group members and discussed our proposed ideas for our new project. We decided on a website dedicated to finding homes for pets; an adoption base website much like the SPCA one. After this was confirmed we took to work building our user stories, as these would be vastly useful to constructing the theoretical idea of our website and how it would operate. We began listing questions we’d ask the SPCA representative we were aiming to meet with, along with listing pages the website would have and the corresponding information they’d contain. Having this all listed out would help us to better understand our user flows.

            We met up in person and began discussing our various user flows and our expectations for the aesthetic of the website. We took a preliminary look at what aspect we could incorporate to set ourselves apart from our competitors. A key point was our venture in the construction of our block frames. We all created two iterations of each page for the website, leaving us with a variety of different options to analyze and amalgamate successfully. Once we had enough iterations of our block frames, we began discussing font and color elements to be involved in our style guide. We’re making slight progress on our wireframes, testing out our general idea pulled from the block frames, and making adjustments based on our ideal style guide as we go.

            We overviewed the draft versions of the wireframes and began finalizing them, making decisions as a team. We analyzed and overviewed text sizes and weights, the curvature of corners, levels of white space, and information to be presented. We then went away to individually write up rules for the style guide and create draft versions of the wireframes for mobile application.

            This week began by creating new iterations of our prototypes based off of Blaine’s feedback. We then joined a call together with Blaine to get further feedback on our iterations, before accumulating our most successful efforts into a set of prototypes we were happy with. Once the prototypes were ready for user testing, we created a questionnaire for our testers to fill out subsequent to testing. We also had our prototype presentations in front of the class, where different groups and the teacher gave us constructive feedback and pointed out what wasn’t working. Once we had the presentation feedback, along with the questionnaire results; we decided to compile a to do list of adjustments to complete before the next class.

            This week was all about finalizing our design choices so that our prototype would be complete, and we could transition into coding. A big change that we made in our finalization process was the darkening of our primary and secondary teal colors. This felt awkward at first but upon consideration we acknowledged the heightened levels of contrast and legibility it provided.

            The blog project started out as something tiresome and frustrating but as I grew to understand HTML and CSS somewhat better, the experience became more enjoyable. Trying again and again with no results until the refresh button would eventually yield some sort of change on the live server was a great feeling and pushed me to keep trying new things with my blog. The final outcome of my blog visually deviates from my Figma prototypes to an extent, which I put down to the vast distance between my coding skills and my design knowledge. Although I tried, I could never quite make my blog replicate the sleek design I had prototyped; with a lack of white space and extravagance in size for some elements being a key difference. This was alright though, because I was proud to have made something from scratch; and navigating through the pages brought me a sense of pride along with the knowledge I gained from the various setbacks.
